!If your work space is in AWS or remote by network, It can cause serious problems.!

Instructions for using the program can be found in 'minifirewall.c'.

sudo ./minifirewall --in --proto ALL --action BLOCK : All block. [DO NOT EXECUTE IN NETWORK WORKSPACE.]
                                 TCP                : Only block TCP packet.
                                 UDP                : Only block UDP packet.
                                 ICMP               : Only block ICMP packet.
